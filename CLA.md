Thank you for your interest in **The Nivenly Foundation Projects** ("The project", "nivenly project", "foundation's projects", "a project", "the subproject", or "a subproject"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the project must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the project. In return, the project shall not use Your Contributions in a way that is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its bylaws in effect at the time of the Contribution. Except for the license granted herein to the project and recipients of software distributed by the project, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.
